/** \file ghosts.h    Ghost particles and particle exchange.
 *
 *  <b>Responsible:</b>
 *  <a href="mailto:limbach@mpip-mainz.mpg.de">Hanjo</a>
 *
 *  In this file you find everything concerning the exchange of
 *  particle data (particles, ghosts, positions and forces) for short
 *  range interactions between the spacial domains of neighbouring
 *  nodes.
 *
 *  All structures are initialized by \ref ghost_pre_init and \ref
 *  ghost_init.
 *
 *  Exchanging particles that move from one cell to another including
 *  crossing of node domain boundaries is done by \ref
 *  exchange_and_sort_part. 
 *
 *  Setup of the ghost particle frame is done by \ref exchange_ghost.
 *
 *  During integration the ghost positions and forces are exchanged by
 *  \ref update_ghost_pos and \ref collect_ghost_forces.
 *
 *  Communication \anchor communication is done only between
 *  neighboring nodes. The communication scheme can be seen in the
 *  figure below.
 *
 *  \image html ghost_communication.gif "Scheme of ghost/particle communication"
 *  \image latex ghost_communication.eps "Scheme of ghost/particle communication" width=8cm 
 *
 *  To reduce the number of communications per node from 26 (number of
 *  neighbor nodes in 3 dimensions) to 6 the order of the
 *  communication is important:
 *  <ol> 
 *      <li> x-direction: left and right
 *      <li> y-direction: forth and back 
 *      <li> z-direction: down and up 
 *  </ol>
 *  In this way also edges and corners are communicated
 *  (See also \ref directions for our conventions).
 *
 *  \warning \b Since the ghost particle structures make use of the
 *  linked cell structure, \ref ghost_init has to be called after \ref
 *  cells_re_init 
 *
 *  For more information on ghosts,
 *  see \ref ghosts.c "ghosts.c"
