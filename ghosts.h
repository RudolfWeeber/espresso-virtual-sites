/** \file ghosts.h    Ghost particles and particle exchange.
 *
 *  <b>Responsible:</b>
 *  <a href="mailto:limbach@mpip-mainz.mpg.de">Hanjo</a>
 *
 *  In this file you find everything concerning the exchange of
 *  particle data (particles, ghosts, positions and forces) for short
 *  range interactions between the spacial domains of neighbouring
 *  nodes.
 *
 *  All structures are initialized by \ref ghost_init.  Exchanging
 *  particles that move from one to another node domain is done by
 *  \ref exchange_part. Setup of the ghost particle frame is done by
 *  \ref exchange_ghost. Call \ref sort_particles_into_cells before
 *  each use of \ref exchange_ghost. During integration using a verlet
 *  list ghost positions and forces are exchanged by \ref
 *  update_ghost_pos and \ref collect_ghost_forces. Before calling
 *  \ref ghost_init again tou should clean up with \ref ghost_exit.
 *
 *  Communication \anchor communication is done only between
 *  neighboring nodes. The communication scheme can be senn in the
 *  figure below.
 *
 *  \image html ghost_communication.gif "Scheme of ghost/particle communication"
 *  \image latex ghost_communication.eps "Scheme of ghost/particle communication" width=8cm 
 *
 *  To reduce the number of communications per node from 26 (number of
 *  neighbor nodes in 3 dimensions) to 6 the order of the
 *  communication is important:
 *  <ol> 
 *      <li> x-direction: left and right
 *      <li> y-direction: forth and back 
 *      <li> z-direction: down and up 
 *  </ol>
 *  In this way also edges and corners are communicated
 *  (See also \ref directions for our conventions).
 *
 *  \warning \b Since the ghost particle structures make use of the
 *  linked cell structure, \ref ghost_init has to be called after \ref
 *  cells_init 
 *
 *  For more information on ghosts,
 *  see \ref ghosts.c "ghosts.c"

 *      <li> Init node neighbours ( \ref calc_node_neighbors ).
 *      <li> Init particle exchange buffers.

 *      <li> Init ghost exchange cell structures: The \ref exchange_ghost
 *           makes use of the linked cell structure (\ref cells) and hence
 *           needs more complicated structures for bookkeeping:
 *           <ul>
 *               <li> \ref send_cells is a list of all cells to send. 
 *               <li> \ref recv_cells is a list of all cells to receive. 
 *               <li> \ref n_send_ghosts contains the number of particles 
 *                    in each send cell. 
 *               <li> \ref n_recv_ghosts contains the number of particles 
 *                    in each recv cell. 
 *           </ul>
 *           All lists have the length \ref ntot_send_cells and are
 *           divided into blocks of cells send to/received from
 *           different directions. The block length is stored in \ref
 *           n_send_cells[d] , \ref n_recv_cells[d] and the beginning
 *           of each block is stored in \ref cell_start[d] . This is
 *           exemplary shown in the figure \anchor ghost_cells_fig below.
 *
 * \image html ghost_cells.gif "ghost exchange: cell structures"
 * \image latex ghost_cells.eps "ghost exchange: cell structures" \width=15cm
 *
 *           In the example it is shown which cells Node 2 receives
 *           from Node 1 from direction 0 (left) and which cells Node
 *           2 sends to Node 3 in direction 2 (down).
 *           
 *           (see \ref exchange_ghost for more details).
