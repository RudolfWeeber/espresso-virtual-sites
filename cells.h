 *
 *  This modul strongly interacts with the ghost particle
 *  structure (ghosts.c) and the verlet list algorithm (verlet.c). The
 *  initialization (cells_init()) and cleaning up (cells_exit()) is
 *  called from the integrator (integrate.c).
 *
 *  The domain of a node is split into a 3D cell grid with dimension
 *  cell_grid. Together with one ghost cell layer on each side the
 *  overall dimension of the ghost cell grid is ghost_cell_grid.
 *  You can see a 2D graphical representation of the linked cell grid below.

 *
 *  2D representation of a linked cell grid: n_cells = 64, cell_grid =
 *  {4,4}, ghost_cell_grid = {6,6}
 *
 * Each cell has 3^D neighbor cells (For cell 14 they are
 * marked). Since we deal with pair forces, it is sufficient to
 * calculate only half of the interactions (Newtons law: actio =
 * reactio). I have chosen the upper half e.g. all neighbor cells with
 * a higher linear index (For cell 14 they are marked in light
 * blue). Caution: This implementation needs double sided ghost
 * communication! For single sided ghost communication one would need
 * some ghost-ghost cell interaction as well, which we do not need!

      A word about the interacting neighbor cells:

      In a 3D lattice each cell has 27 neighbors (including
      itself!). Since we deal with pair forces, it is sufficient to
      calculate only half of the interactions (Newtons law: actio =
      reactio). For each cell 13+1=14 neighbors. This has only to be
      done for the inner cells. 

      Caution: This implementation needs double sided ghost
      communication! For single sided ghost communication one would
      need some ghost-ghost cell interaction as well, which we do not
      need! 

      It follows: inner cells: n_neighbors=14
      ghost cells: n_neighbors=0
