/** \file specfunc.h
    This file contains implementations for some special functions which are needed by the MMM family of
    algorithms. This are the modified Hurwitz zeta function and the modified Bessel functions of first
    and second kind. The implementations are based on the GSL code (see \ref specfunc.c "specfunc.c"
    for the original GSL header).

    The Hurwitz zeta function is evaluated using the Euler-MacLaurin summation formula, the Bessel functions
    are evaluated using several different Chebychev expansions. Both achieve a precision of nearly machine
    precision, which is no problem for the Hurwitz zeta function, which is only used when determining the
    coefficients for the modified polygamma functions (see \ref mmm-common.h "mmm-common.h"). However, the
    Bessel functions are actually used in the near formula of MMM2D, which is therefore slightly slower than
    necessary. On the other hand, the number of terms in the Bessel sum is quite small normally, so that a less
    precise version will probably not generate a huge computational speed improvement.
