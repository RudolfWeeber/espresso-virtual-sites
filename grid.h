/** \file grid.h   Domain decomposition for parallel computing.

 *  <b>Responsible:</b>
 *  <a href="mailto:limbach@mpip-mainz.mpg.de">Hanjo</a>
 *
 *  The primary simulation box is divided into orthogonal rectangular
 *  subboxes which are assigned to the different nodes (or processes
 *  or processors or threads if you want). This grid is described in
 *  \ref node_grid. Each node has a number \ref this_node and a
 *  position \ref node_pos in that grid. Each node has also 6 nearest
 *  neighbors \ref node_neighbors which are necessary for the
 *  communication between the nodes (see also \ref ghosts.c and \ref
 *  p3m.c for more details about the communication.
 *
 *  For the 6 directions \anchor directions we have the following convention:
 *
 *  \image html directions.gif "Convention for the order of the directions"
 *  \image latex directions.eps "Convention for the order of the directions" width=6cm
 *
 *  The Figure illustrates the direction convetion used for arrays
 *  with 6 (e.g. \ref node_neighbors, \ref boundary) and 3 entries
 *  (e.g \ref node_grid, \ref box_l , \ref my_left,...).
 *  
 *  Attention: If you change anything of the simulation box dimensions
 *  you have to call \ref changed_topology.
 *
 *  For more information on the domain decomposition, see \ref grid.c "grid.c".
