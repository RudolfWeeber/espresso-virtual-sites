/** \file p3m.h   main header-file for MDLC (magnetic dipolar layer correction).
 *
 *  <b>Responsible:</b>
 *  <a href="somewhere.de"> CP  JJ </a>
 *
 *  Developer: Joan J. Cerda.
 *  Purpose:   get the corrections for dipolar 3D algorithms 
 *             when applied to a slab geometry and dipolar
 *	      particles. DLC & co
 *  Article:   A. Brodka, Chemical Physics Letters 400, 62-67 (2004).
 * 	      
 *	      We also include a tuning function that returns the
 *	      cut-off necessary to attend a certain accuracy.
 *	      
 *  Restrictions: the slab must be such that the z is the short 
 *                direction. Othewise we get trash.    	      
 * 
 *  Limitations:  at this moment it is restricted to work with 1 cpu
