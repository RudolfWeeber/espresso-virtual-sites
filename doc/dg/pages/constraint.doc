/** \page tcl_constraint The constraint command
        \verbatim constraint <type_name | delete> [parameters] \endverbatim
	A constraint is a surface which interacts with the desired particles via a Lennard-Jones potential.
	\f[4 \epsilon \left(\left(\frac{\sigma}{r}\right)^{12} -
	\left(\frac{\sigma}{r}\right)^6 + shift\right)\f]
	with r being the distance of the center of the particle to the surface. 
	The corresponding force acts in direction of the normal vector of the surface. The constraints are identified like a particle for the lennard-jones force calculation.
	Possible surfaces are:
	\verbatim constraint wall normal <n_x> <n_y> <n_z> dist <d> type <id>  \endverbatim
	The resulting surface is a plane defined by the normal vector 
	\<n_x\> \<n_y\> \<n_z\> and the distance \<d\> from the origin.     
	\verbatim constraint sphere center <c_x> <c_y> <c_z> radius <rad> direction <direction> type <id> \endverbatim
	The resulting surface is a sphere with center \<c_x\> \<c_y\> \<c_z\> 
	and radius \<rad\>. The \<direction\> determines the force direction, -1 or <i>inside</i> for inward and +1 or <i>outside</i> for outward
	\verbatim constraint cylinder center <c_x> <c_y> <c_z> axis <n_x> <n_y> <n_z> radius <rad>
     length <length> direction <direction> type <id> \endverbatim
	The resulting surface is a cylinder with center \<c_x\> \<c_y\> \<c_z\> 
	and radius \<rad\>. The \<length\> parameter is not the whole length but a half of the cylinder length.
	The \<axis\> is a vector along the cylinder axis, which is normalized in the program. The \<direction\> is defined the same way as for the spherical constraint.
	\verbatim constraint maze nsphere <n> dim <d> sphrad <r_s> cylrad <r_c> type 10 <id> \endverbatim
    The resulting surface is \<n\> spheres of radius \<r_s\> along each dimension, connected by cylinders of radius \<r_c\>. The spheres have simple cubic symmetry. The spheres are distributed evenly by dividing the \<box_l\> by \<n\>. Dimension of the maze can be controlled by \<d\>: 0 for one dimensional, 1 for two dimensional and 2 for three dimensional maze.
    
	\verbatim constraint force <n> \endverbatim
	gives the force actinng on the \<n\>ths constraint.
	\verbatim constraint delete <num> \endverbatim
	Delete constraint with number \<num\>. 
	This may change the numbers of the other constraints. 
	The contraint numbers can be obtained with:
	\verbatim constraint \endverbatim
	Print out all constraint information.
    
    After a type is defined for each constraint one has to define the interaction of all different particle types with the constraint using the \verbatim inter \endverbatim command.
