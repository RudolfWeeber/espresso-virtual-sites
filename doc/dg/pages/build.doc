/** \page build_system The build system

The build system of ESPResSo makes use of the GNU autotools suite
consisting of 
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/automake/">automake</a> 
and 
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf/autoconf.html">autoconf</a>.
If you want to modifiy the build system or if you want to 
\ref new_files "add files to ESPResSo", you first need to install
both of these tools.

The central files of the build system are the following:
- \c configure.ac
- \c config/*.m4
- \c Makefile-am.am
- \c Makefile
- the different \c Makefile.am in the subdirectories

Explain:
- Recursive call of \c configure
- EXTRA_DIST
- \c myconfig.h

\section autogen Running autogen.sh

The script <tt>autogen.sh</tt> in the top level source directory can
be used to run \c automake, \c autoconf and the associated tools to
generate the \c configure script and the \c Makefile.in used during
compilation.

\section create_distro Creating an ESPResSo distribution

As described in the User's Guide, to create a <tt>.tar.gz</tt>
distribution file that contains all files required for ESPResSo, you
can simply run <tt>make dist</tt>. This will bundle all files and put
them into an archive with the name
<tt>Espresso-</tt><i>version</i><tt>.tar.gz</tt>.

Even better, you can also run <tt>make distcheck</tt>. This will not
just create the distribution file, but it will also thoroughly check
the created distribution, i.e. it will try to
- unpack the distro
- configure it (<tt>configure</tt>)
- compile it (<tt>make</tt>)
- run the testsuite (<tt>make check</tt>)
- install it (<tt>make install</tt>)
- uninstall it (<tt>make uninstall</tt>)

Whenever something goes wrong in these checks, it will give an error
message that describes the problem. When everything goes fine, you can
be relatively sure that you have a useful ESPResSo distribution
package.

In some cases, it might be necessary to pass some options to the run
of \c configure done by <tt>make distcheck</tt>. To do that, you can
set the environment variable \c DISTCHECK_CONFIGURE_FLAGS to the
required options.

Example:
\verbatim
DISTCHECK_CONFIGURE_FLAGS="--without-mpi CPPFLAGS=\"-I /usr/include/tcl8.4\"" \
  make distcheck
\endverbatim
