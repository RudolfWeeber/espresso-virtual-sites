/** \page new_files How to add new files to ESPResSo

To add new files to ESPResSo (like C-source-files or C-header-files)
you need to do the following:
- add the files to the corresponding 
  <tt>\ref automake_file "Makefile.am"</tt>
- run <tt>\ref autogen "autogen.sh"</tt> to regenerate
  <tt>configure</tt> and the different <tt>Makefile.in</tt>
- (ideally, you should also check the distribution by running 
   <tt>\ref create_distro "make distcheck"</tt>
- add the new file(s) and changed Makefiles to the \ref our_cvs "CVS"
