/** \page features Features of the Espresso program

Espresso provides a number of features that can be compiled into the
program. It is recommended to turn on only the required features to
optimise Espresso for your problem.

\section all_features List of features


\subsection basic Basic features
<dl>
  <dt> PARTIAL_PERIODIC
  <dd>
  if defined, the code will be slower, but with the \ref #periodic
  array you can choose which coordinates are bound to p.b.c and
  which are not. If not defined, all coordinates are bound to
  p.b.c.

  Has effect on: per_callback(), #fields, and functions in
  domain_decomposition.c, grid.c, interaction_data.c, layered.c, statistics_chain.c

  <dt>ELECTROSTATICS
  <dd>Enable charges and the various electrostatics algorithms.

  <dt>ROTATION
  <dd>Enable describing and processing particle orientations. This
  will allow to use such particle properties as quart, omega, and torque. 
    
  <dt>EXTERNAL_FORCES
  <dd>Enable external forces. Eg. apply a fixed external force to a
   particle or fix a particle in space.

   <dt>CONSTRAINTS
   <dd>Enable constraints, eg. walls or spheres. See constraint.h and
   interaction_data.h

   <dt>MASS
   <dd>Allow particles to have different masses.

   <dt>EXCLUSIONS
   <dd>Exclusion of nonbonded interactions for specific particle pairs.
   Currently works only with domain decomposition and Verlet lists.

   <dt>COMFORCE
   <dd>Enable the COMFORCE potential.

   <dt>COMFIXED
   <dd>Enable the COMFIXED potential.

   <dt>MOLFORCES
   <dd> Enables molecular forces. At present this only includes the
   trapping of molecules in a harmonic potential

   <dt>BOND_CONSTRAINT
   <dd>Enable bond constraints. See rattle.h (merged but not
    tested). If you need this, I wish you happy debugging.
</dl>

\subsection short_range_potentials Short ranged potentials

For optimization it might be useful to switch off the ones you don't need.

<dl>
    <dt>LENNARD_JONES
    <dd>Enable the 12-6-Lennard-Jones potential.

    <dt>LJ_WARN_WHEN_CLOSE
    <dd>If defined, you will get a warning when particles approach
    closer than 0.9 \f$\sigma\f$, because then it's likely the
    integration will blow up.

    <dt>MORSE
    <dd>Enable the Morse potential.

    <dt>LJCOS
    <dd>Enable the Lennard-Jones potential with cosine tail.

    <dt>BUCKINGHAM
    <dd>Enable the Buckingham potential.
    
    <dt>SOFT_SPHERE
    <dd>Enable the soft sphere potential.
</dl>


\subsection angle_potential Angle potential

Important: Activate <b>only one</b> of the possible variants!

Unpredicted behaviour will occur if you enable more than one!

<dl>
    <dt>BOND_ANGLE_HARMONIC
    <dd>Harmonic bond angle potential: \f$V = \frac{1}{2} k (\phi - \phi_0)^2\f$

    <dt>BOND_ANGLE_COSINE
    <dd>Cosine bond angle potential: \f$V = k (1+\cos(\phi-\phi_0))\f$

    <dt>BOND_ANGLE_COSSQUARE
    <dd>Cosine square bond angle potential: 
	\f$V = \frac{1}{2} k (\cos(\phi)-cos(\phi_0))^2\f$

</dl>

\subsection methods Simulation methods, integrators and thermostats
<dl>
    <dt>NEMD
    <dd>Non Eqilibrium Molecular Dynamics. This is used to perform
    shear simulations.

    <dt>NPT
    <dd>Allows to use (N,p,T)-ensembles during integration as well.

    <dt>DPD
    <dd>DPD Thermostat (Dissipative Particle Dynamics). Flag needed
    only because DPD acts like a short range potential.

    <dt>LB
    <dd>LB Thermostat (fluctuating Lattice Boltzmann fluid).

</dl>

\section tcl_features Checking for features in the Espresso Tcl-Script
In the Espresso-script, you can get information whether or not one or
some of \ref all_features "the features above" are compiled into the
current program with help of the following Tcl-commands:

<ul>
    <li>\anchor tcl_code_info
	\verbatim code_info \endverbatim
	provides information on the version, compilation status and
	the debug status of the used code. It is highly recommended to
	store this information with your simulation data in order to
	maintain the reproducibility of your results.
 
	\par Exemplaric output: 
\verbatim
ESPRESSO: v1.5.Beta (Neelix), Last Change: 23.01.2004
{ Compilation status { PARTIAL_PERIODIC } { ELECTROSTATICS } { EXTERNAL_FORCES } { CONSTRAINTS } { TABULATED } { LENNARD_JONES } { BOND_ANGLE_COSINE } }
{ Debug status { MPI_CORE FORCE_CORE } }
\endverbatim

    <li>\anchor tcl_has_feature
	\verbatim has_feature <feature> ...\endverbatim
	tests, if \<feature\> is compiled into the Espresso kernel. 
	A list of possible features and their names can be found 
	\ref config.h "here".

    <li>\anchor tcl_require_feature
	\verbatim require_feature <feature> ...\endverbatim
	tests, if \<feature\> is feature is compiled into the Espresso
	kernel, will exit the script if it isn't and return the error
	code 42.
	A list of possible features and their names can be found 
	\ref config.h "here".
</ul>

\section compile_features Adding and removing features from the Espresso program

The file config.h contains the preprocessor switches that can be used
to activate or deactivate a certain feature in Espresso.
It is recommended to turn everything off which you do not need in
order to optimize the performance of Espresso for your problem. There
are also quite a number of  features which are turned off by default
since they are used only rarely.
