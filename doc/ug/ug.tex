\chapter{Introduction}
\label{chap:intro}

(new)

\begin{itemize}
\item \es{} is a generic soft matter simulation packages
\item for molecular dynamics simulations in soft matter research
\item focussed on coarse-grained models
\item employs modern algorithms (Lattice-Boltzmann, DPD, P3M, \ldots)
\item written in C for maximal portability
\item Tcl-controlled
\item parallelized
\end{itemize}

\section{Guiding principles}
\label{sec:ideas}

(from paper: 2.1 Goals and principles)

\es
\begin{itemize}
\item does \emph{not} do the physics for you!
\item requires you to understand what you do (can not be used as a
  black box)
\item gives you maximal freedom (flexibility)
\item is extensible
\item integrates system setup, simulation and analysis, as this can't
  be strictly separated in soft matter simulations
\item has no predefined units
\item sets as few defaults as possible
\end{itemize}

\section{Algorithms contained in \es}

The following algorithms are implemented in \es{}:

\begin{itemize}
\item ensembles: NVE, NVT, NpT
\item charged systems:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item P3M for fully periodic systems
  \item ELC and MMM-family of algorithms for charged systems with
    non-periodic boundary conditions
  \item Maggs algorithm 
  \end{itemize}
\item Hydrodynamics:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item DPD (as a thermostat)
  \item Lattice-Boltzmann
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\section{Basic program structure}
\label{sec:structure}

(from paper: 2.2 Basic program structure)

\begin{itemize}
\item Control level: \texttt{Tcl}
\item ``Kernel'' written in \texttt{C}
\item This manual will focus on the control level
\end{itemize}

\section{On units}
\label{sec:units}

(new)

\begin{itemize}
\item Reduced units
\item comparison to ``real units''
\item three examples on different length scales
  \begin{itemize}
  \item some atomistic model?
  \item coarse-grained model (\eg lipid bilayer)
  \item billards?
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\include{installation}

\chapter{Tutorial}
\label{chap:tutorial}

(from \verb!erice_tutorial! or appendix A from paper)

\begin{itemize}
\item \es: script interpreter
\item interactive use (sample session)
\item script execution
\item example script
\item Reference to \verb!tutorial.tcl! (?)
\end{itemize}

\chapter{Features of \es{}}
\label{chap:features}

\chapter{\es{} command reference}
\label{chap:ref}

(most from paper and from related pages)

\begin{itemize}
\item Will contain description of all Tcl-commands
\item Reference to appendix \vref{chap:quickref}
\item basic identifiers:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item particle type
  \item bonded interaction type
  \item molecule id
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}


\section{\texttt{inter}: Setting up interactions}
\label{sec:inter}
\begin{syntax}
  \variant{1}
  {inter 
    \var{part\_type\_id1} 
    \var{part\_type\_id2}
    \var{inter\_type} 
    [ \var{parameters}\ldots ]
  }
  \variant{2}
  {inter 
    \var{bond\_type\_id} \var{bond\_type} [
    \var{parameters}\ldots ]
  }
  \variant{3}
  {inter}
\end{syntax}

\chapter{Under the hood}
\label{chap:underhood}

(new)

\begin{itemize}
\item Implementation issues that are interesting for the user
\item Main loop in pseudo code (for comparison)
\item from doxygen: ``Cell systems'' 
\end{itemize}


\chapter{Getting involved}

\begin{itemize}
\item What to do when you want to become involved
\item How to submit a bug report
\end{itemize}


\appendix
