\section{Writing VTF files}
%\quickrefheading{Handling of VTF files}

There are two commands in \es{} that support writing files in the VMD
formats VTF, VSF and VCF.\footnote{A description of the format and a
  plugin to read the format in VMD is found in the subdirectory
  \texttt{vmdplugin/} of the \es{} source directory.} The commands can
be used to write the structure (\texttt{writevsf}) and coordinates
(\texttt{writevcf}) of the system to a single trajectory file (usually
with the extension \texttt{.vtf}), or to separate files (extensions
\texttt{.vsf} and \texttt{.vtf}).

\subsection{\texttt{writevsf}}

\tclcommand{writevsf}
{\var{channelId} \opt{<short|verbose>} \opt{radius <\var{radii}|auto>} \opt{typedesc \var{typedesc}}}

Writes a structure block describing the system's structure to the
channel given by \var{channelId}. \var{channelId} must be an
identifier for an open channel such as the return value of an
invocation of \keyword{open}. The atom ids used in the file are
identical to \es's particle ids.  This makes it easy to write
additional structure lines to the file, e.g. to specify the
\texttt{resname} of particle compounds, like chains.  The output of
this file can be used in a standalone VSF file, or at the beginning of
a trajectory VTF file that contains a trajectory of a whole
simulation.

\begin{arguments}
\item[\opt{<short|verbose>}]
  Specify, whether the output is in a human-readable, but somewhat
  longer format (\keyword{verbose}), or in a more compact form
  (\keyword{short}). The default is \keyword{verbose}.
  
\item[\opt{radius <\var{radii}|auto>}]
  Specify the VDW radii of the atoms. \var{radii} is either
  \keyword{auto}, or a Tcl-list describing the radii of the different
  particle types. When the keyword \keyword{auto} is used and a
  Lennard-Jones interaction between two particles of the given type is
  defined, the radius is set to be $\frac{\sigma_{LJ}}{2}$ plus the LJ
  shift.  Otherwise, the radius $0.5$ is substituted. The default is
  \keyword{auto}.
  
  Example: \verb!writevsf $file radius {{0 2.0} {1 auto} {2 1.0}}!
  
\item[\opt{typedesc \var{typedesc}}]
  \var{typedesc} is a Tcl-list giving additional VTF atom-keywords to
  specify additional VMD characteristics of the atoms of the given type.
  If no description is given for a certain particle type, it defaults to
  \texttt{segid \textit{n}}, where \textit{n} is the type id.
  
  Example: \verb!writevsf $file typedesc {{0 "segid colloid"} {1 "segid pe"}}!
\end{arguments}


\subsection{\texttt{writevcf}}
\tclcommand{writevcf}
{\var{channelId} [<short|verbose>] [<folded|absolute>]}

Writes a coordinate (or timestep) block that contains all coordinates
of the system's particles to the channel given by \var{channelId}.
\var{channelId} must be an identifier for an open channel such as the
return value of an invocation of \keyword{open}.

\begin{arguments}
\item[\opt{<short|verbose>}] Specify, whether the output is in a
  human-readable, but somewhat longer format (\keyword{verbose}), or
  in a more compact form (\keyword{short}). The default is
  \keyword{verbose}.
  
\item[\opt{<folded|absolute>}] Specify whether the particle positions
  are written in absolute coordinates (\keyword{absolute}) or folded
  into the central image of a periodic system (\keyword{folded}). The
  default is \keyword{absolute}.
  
\item[\opt{pids <\var{pids}|all>}] Specify the coordinates of which
  particles should be written. If \keyword{all} is used, all
  coordinates will be written (in the ordered timestep format).
  Otherwise, \var{pids} has to be a Tcl-list specifying the pids of
  the particles. The default is \keyword{all}.
  
  Example: \verb!pids {0 23 42}!
  
\end{arguments}
