\index{features|mainindex}

This chapter describes the features that can be activated in \es. Even
if possible, it is not recommended to activate all features, because
this will negatively effect \es's performance.

Features can be activated in the configuration header
\texttt{myconfig.h} (see section \vref{sec:myconfig}). Too activate
\texttt{FEATURE}, add the following line to the header file:
\begin{verbatim}
#define FEATURE
\end{verbatim}

\section{General features}

\begin{itemize}
\item \feature{PARTIAL\_PERIODIC} By default, all coordinates in \es{}
  are periodic. With \texttt{PARTIAL\_PERIODIC} turned on, the \es{}
  global variable \texttt{periodic} (see section \vref{tcl:setmd})
  controls the periodicity of the individual coordinates. Note that
  this slows the integrator down by around $10-30\%$.
\item \feature{ELECTROSTATICS} This switches on the various
  electrostatics algorithms, such as P3M. See section
  \vref{sec:inter-electrostatics} for details on these algorithms.
\item \feature{ROTATION} Switch on rotational degrees of freedom for
  the particles, as well as the corresponding quaternion integrator.
  See section \vref{sec:rotation} for details.
  \todo{Docs for rotation missing}
\item \feature{DIPOLES} This activates the dipole support in P$^3$M.
  Currently, a mixing of dipoles and charges is not possible, \ie all
  particles have to have charge $q=0$.  Requires
  \texttt{ELECTROSTATICS} and \texttt{ROTATION}.
\item \feature{EXTERNAL\_FORCES} Allows to define an arbitrary
  constant force for each particle individually. Also allows to fix
  individual coordinates of particles, \eg keep them at a fixed
  position or within a plane.
\item \feature{CONSTRAINTS} Turns on various spatial constraints such
  as spherical compartments or walls. This constraints interact with
  the particles through regular short ranged potentials such as the
  Lennard--Jones potential. See section \vref{tcl:constraint} for
  possible constraint forms.
\item \feature{MASS} Allows particles to have individual masses. Note
  that some analysis procedures have not yet been adapted to take the
  masses into account correctly.
\item \feature{EXCLUSIONS} Allows to exclude specific short ranged
  interactions within molecules.
\item \feature{COMFORCE} \todo{Docs missing}
\item \feature{COMFIXED} \todo{Docs missing}
\item \feature{MOLFORCES} \todo{Docs missing}
\item \feature{BOND\_CONSTRAINT} Turns on the RATTLE integrator which
  allows for fixed lengths bonds between particles. \todo{How to use it?}
\end{itemize}

In addition, there are switches that enable additional features in the
integrator:
\begin{itemize}
\item \feature{NEMD} Enables the non-equilbrium (shear) MD support
  (see section \vref{sec:NEMD}).\todo{Docs missing}
\item \feature{NPT} Enables an on--the--fly NPT integration scheme
  (see section \vref{sec:NPT}).\todo{Docs missing}
\item \feature{DPD} Enables the dissipative particle dynamics
  thermostat (see section \vref{sec:DPD}).\todo{Docs missing}
\item \feature{LB} Enables the lattice-Boltzmann fluid code (see
  section \vref{sec:LB}).\todo{Docs missing}
\end{itemize}

\section{Interactions}

The following switches turn on various short ranged interactions (see section
\vref{sec:inter-nb}):
\begin{itemize}
\item \feature{TABULATED} Enable support for user--defined
  interactions.
\item \feature{LENNARD\_JONES} Enable the Lennard--Jones potential.
\item \feature{LJ\_WARN\_WHEN\_CLOSE} This adds an additional check to
  the Lennard--Jones potential that prints a warning of particles come
  too close so that the simulation becomes unphysical.
\item \feature{MORSE} Enable the Morse potential.
\item \feature{LJCOS} Enable the Lennard--Jones potential with a cosine--tail.
\item \feature{LJCOS2}
\item \feature{BUCKINGHAM} Enable the Buckingham potential.
\item \feature{SOFT\_SPHERE} Enable the soft sphere potential.
\end{itemize}

If you want to use bondangle potentials, you currently need to choose
the type by the feature (see section \vref{sec:angle}). This will
change in the near future to three independent angle potentials:
\begin{itemize}
\item \feature{BOND\_ANGLE\_HARMONIC}
\item \feature{BOND\_ANGLE\_COSINE}
\item \feature{BOND\_ANGLE\_COSSQUARE}
\end{itemize}

\section{Debug messages}

Finally, there are a number of flags for debugging. The most important
one are
\begin{itemize}
\item \feature{ADDITIONAL\_CHECKS} Enables numerous additional checks
  which can detect inconsistencies especially in the cell systems.
  This checks are however too slow to be enabled in production runs.
\item \feature{MEM\_DEBUG} Enables an internal memory allocation
  checking system. This produces output for each allocation and
  freeing of a memory chunk, and therefore allows to track down memory
  leaks. This works by internally replacing \texttt{malloc},
  \texttt{realloc} and \texttt{free}.
\end{itemize}

The following flags control the debug output of various sections of
Espresso. You will however understand the output very often only by
looking directly at the code.
\begin{itemize}
\item \feature{COMM\_DEBUG} Output from the asynchronous communication code.
\item \feature{EVENT\_DEBUG} Notifications for event calls, i.~e. the
  \texttt{on\_?} functions in \texttt{initialize.c}. Useful if some
  module does not correctly respond to changes of e.~g.  global
  variables.
\item \feature{INTEG\_DEBUG} Integrator output.
\item \feature{CELL\_DEBUG} Cellsystem output.
\item \feature{GHOST\_DEBUG} Cellsystem output specific to the
  handling of ghost cells and the ghost cell communication.
\item \feature{GHOST\_FORCE\_DEBUG}
\item \feature{VERLET\_DEBUG} Debugging of the Verlet list code of the
  domain decomposition cell system.
\item \feature{LATTICE\_DEBUG} Universal lattice structure debugging.
\item \feature{HALO\_DEBUG}
\item \feature{GRID\_DEBUG}
\item \feature{PARTICLE\_DEBUG} Output from the particle handling code.
\item \feature{P3M\_DEBUG}
\item \feature{ESR\_DEBUG} debugging of P$^3$Ms real space part.
\item \feature{ESK\_DEBUG} debugging of P$^3$Ms $k$--space part.
\item \feature{EWALD\_DEBUG}
\item \feature{FFT\_DEBUG} Output from the unified FFT code.
\item \feature{MAGGS\_DEBUG}
\item \feature{RANDOM\_DEBUG}
\item \feature{FORCE\_DEBUG} Output from the force calculation loops.
\item \feature{THERMO\_DEBUG} Output from the thermostats.
\item \feature{LJ\_DEBUG} Output from the Lennard--Jones code.
\item \feature{MORSE\_DEBUG} Output from the Morse code.
\item \feature{FENE\_DEBUG}
\item \feature{ONEPART\_DEBUG} Define to a number of a particle to
  obtain output on the forces calculated for this particle.
\item \feature{STAT\_DEBUG}
\item \feature{POLY\_DEBUG}
\item \feature{MOLFORCES\_DEBUG}
\item \feature{LB\_DEBUG} Output from the lattice--Boltzmann code.
\item \feature{ASYNC\_BARRIER} Introduce a barrier after each
  asynchronous command completion. Helps in detection of mismatching
  communication.
\item \feature{FORCE\_CORE} Causes \es{} to try to provoke a core dump
  when exiting unexpectedly.
\item \feature{MPI\_CORE} Causes \es{} to try this even with MPI errors.
