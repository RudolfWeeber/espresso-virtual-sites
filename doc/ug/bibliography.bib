  abstract = {Using molecular dynamics simulations in which we take counterions
	explicitly into account, we study the behavior of a dilute solution
	of strongly charged polyelectrolytes in poor solvents. We focus
	on the chain conformational properties under conditions in which
	chain-chain interactions can be neglected but the counterion concentration
	remains finite. We investigate the conformations with regard to
	the parameters chain length, Coulomb interaction strength, and solvent
	quality and explore in which regime the competition between short-range
	hydrophobic interactions and long-range Coulomb interactions leads
	to pearl-necklace-like structures. We observe that large number
	and size fluctuations in the pearls and strings lead to only small
	direct signatures in experimental observables like the single-chain
	form factor. Furthermore, we do not observe the predicted first-order
	collapse of the necklace into a globular structure when counterion
	condensation sets in. We will also show that the pearl-necklace
	regime is rather small for strongly charged polyelectrolytes at
	finite densities. Even small changes in the charge fraction of the
	chain can have a large impact on the conformation due to the delicate
	interplay between counterion distribution and chain conformation.},
