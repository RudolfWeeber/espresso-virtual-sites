	anomalous behaviour of $S(q)$ for rings and the $t^{0.54}$ power
	law for the motion of a monomer in a self avoiding chain undergoing

  journal = {J. Phys. Chem. B},
  year = {2003},

  pages = {8041--8055},
  number = {32},
  abstract = {Using molecular dynamics simulations in which we take counterions
	explicitly into account, we study the behavior of a dilute solution
	of strongly charged polyelectrolytes in poor solvents. We focus on
	the chain conformational properties under conditions in which chain-chain
	interactions can be neglected but the counterion concentration remains
	finite. We investigate the conformations with regard to the parameters
	chain length, Coulomb interaction strength, and solvent quality and
	explore in which regime the competition between short-range hydrophobic
	interactions and long-range Coulomb interactions leads to pearl-necklace-like
	structures. We observe that large number and size fluctuations in
	the pearls and strings lead to only small direct signatures in experimental
	observables like the single-chain form factor. Furthermore, we do
	not observe the predicted first-order collapse of the necklace into
	a globular structure when counterion condensation sets in. We will
	also show that the pearl-necklace regime is rather small for strongly
	charged polyelectrolytes at finite densities. Even small changes
	in the charge fraction of the chain can have a large impact on the
	conformation due to the delicate interplay between counterion distribution
	and chain conformation.},
