This is the 2.0 beta4 version of TclTutor.tcl.

See the NOTICE file for information about licensing.

		DESCRIPTION
This is a package designed to teach the Tcl programming language in
a quick and easy manner.  The goal is to teach the minimal amount of Tcl
syntax, commands and options that are necessary to write useful programs.

You are encouraged to use the man pages and books to augment this 
tutorial.

This version covers all of the commands in the Tcl language, as of
version 7.4, and most of the commands added in later Tcl revisions.

		REQUIREMENTS
To use this package you'll need:

Unix/Linux:
	Tcl/Tk: version 8.0 or more recent.
	X Windows
	Useful: tkman 

MS Windows:
	Tcl/Tk:  Version 8.0  or more recent.
	Win 95, Win/NT

Also Recommended is to get the Tom Phelps' tkman program, which can
be used to access man pages hypertextually from the program.

		DISCLAIMER

I've tried to make these lessons accurate and complete enough to be
useful, but I won't guarantee that I've succeeded.

This code has been tested under SunOs 4.1.3, Linux, Windows NT, and Win
95.  I expect it to work on those systems.

		REQUEST

Please send me mail if:

1) If you find an error in a lesson

2) You feel some description is too turgid.

3) You've created an error in the code window and *not* gotten the
   correct line highlighted (send me the code that generated this error,
   also, please.)

4) You want to tell me what a wonderful learning experience this was.

5) You successfully (or otherwise) run this package on a system other
    than the ones I have access to for testing.
