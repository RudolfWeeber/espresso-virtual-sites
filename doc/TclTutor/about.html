TclTutor is a Computer Aided Instruction package that teaches the basics
of the Tcl programming language.  
<P>
The 40+ lessons in this package can be completed in under 10 minutes
each. You'll be ready to start simple programs after the first half
dozen lessons.
<P>
This program will teach you the syntax for the main Tcl commands and 
options, but may not provide all the details you need to become a truly
proficient Tcl programmer.
