/** \page testsuite The Testsuite Directory

In the directory Espresso/testsuite you find several scripts that can serve as samples and tests for Espresso.

<ol>
<li> <b> lj_liquid.tcl </b><br>
     Simple Lennard-Jones particle liquid. Shows the basic features of
     Espresso: How to set up system parameters, particles and
     interactions. How to warm up and integrate. How to write
     parameters, configurations and observables to files. How to
     handle the connection to VMD.

<li> <b> kremerGrest.tcl </b><br>

<li> <b> madelung.tcl </b><br>
     Calculates the energy of a NaCl crystal. Test case for the
     electrostatic energy.

<li> <b> pe_solution.tcl </b><br>
     Polyelectrolyte solution under poor solvent condition. Test case
     for comparison with data produced by polysim9 from M.Deserno.
     <ul>
     <li> <b> pe_analyze.tcl </b><br>
          Example for an analyzation after the actual simulation run
          (offline analyzation). Calculates the integrated
          iondistribution P(r).
     </ul>

<li> <b> cell_model.tcl </b><br>
     This example shows the use of \ref tcl_constraint "constraints"
     and non periodic boundary conditions. It simulates a bundle of
     semiflexible polyelectrolyes with hydrophobic side chains
     neutralized by counterions in a spherical simulation cell.

<li> <b> espresso_logo.tcl </b><br>
     The Espresso Logo, the exploding espresso cup, has been created
     with this script. It is a regular simulation of a polyelectrolyte
     solution. It makes use of some nice features of the \ref tcl_part
     command, namely the capability to fix a particle in space and to
     apply an external force.

<li> <b> harmonic_oscillator.tcl </b><br>
     A chain of harmonic oscillators. This is a T=0 simulation to test
     the energy conservation.
</ol>
