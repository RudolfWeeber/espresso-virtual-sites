/** \page testsuite The Testsuite Directory

In the directory Espresso/testsuite you find several scripts that can serve as samples and tests for Espresso.

<ol>
<li> <b> lj_liquid.tcl </b><br>
     Simple Lennard-Jones particle liquid. Shows the basic features of
     Espresso: How to set up system parameters, particles and
     interactions. How to warm up and integrate. How to write
     parameters, configurations and observables to files. How to
     handle the connection to VMD.

<li> <b> kremerGrest.tcl </b><br>
     This reproduces the data of K.Kremer/G.S.Grest, J.Chem.Phys. <b>92</b>(8), 5057-5086 (1990): 
     Multiple systems with different number of neutral polymer chains of various lengths are simulated for very
     long times at melt density 0.85 while their static and some dynamic properties are measured.<br>
     Shows the advanced features of Espresso: How to run several simulations from a single script. How to use online-analysis
     (\ref tcl_analyze) with comparision to expectation values. How to get averages of the observables. How to set/restore 
     checkpoints (\ref io) including auto-detection of previously derived parts of the simulation(s). 
     How to create gnuplots from within the script and combine multiple plots onto duplex pages (\ref statistics). <BR>
     In the end the script will provide plots of all important quantities as .ps- and .pdf-files while compressing the data-files.
     Note however, that the simulation uses the original time scale, hence it may take <i>quite</i> some time to finish.

<li> <b> madelung.tcl </b><br>
     Calculates the energy of a NaCl crystal. Test case for the
     electrostatic energy.

<li> <b> pe_solution.tcl </b><br>
     Polyelectrolyte solution under poor solvent condition. Test case
     for comparison with data produced by polysim9 from M.Deserno.
     <ul>
     <li> <b> pe_analyze.tcl </b><br>
          Example for an analyzation after the actual simulation run
          (offline analyzation). Calculates the integrated
          iondistribution P(r).
     </ul> <BR>
<li> <b> cell_model.tcl </b><br>
     This example shows the use of \ref tcl_constraint "constraints"
     and non periodic boundary conditions. It simulates a bundle of
     semiflexible polyelectrolyes with hydrophobic side chains
     neutralized by counterions in a spherical simulation cell.

<li> <b> diamond.tcl </b><br>
     This reproduces the data of S.Schneider/P.Linse, Eur.Phys.J.E <b>8</b>, 457-460 (2002):
     A diamond-shape network of 16 polyelectrolyte chains with 20 monomers each connected at 8 nodes is simulated for varying
     network packing fractions (densities) while the pressure is analysed (\ref tcl_analyze). 
     Similar to <i>kremerGrest.tcl</i> it additionally uses electrostatics including the auto-tuning feature (\ref tcl_inter).

<li> <b> espresso_logo.tcl </b><br>
     The Espresso Logo, the exploding espresso cup, has been created
     with this script. It is a regular simulation of a polyelectrolyte
     solution. It makes use of some nice features of the \ref tcl_part
     command, namely the capability to fix a particle in space and to
     apply an external force.

<li> <b> harmonic_oscillator.tcl </b><br>
     A chain of harmonic oscillators. This is a T=0 simulation to test
     the energy conservation.
