/** \page writepdb Writing pdb/psf files
    The PDB (Brookhaven Protein DataBase) format is a widely used
    format for describing atomic configurations. PSF is a format
    that is used by VMD to describe the topology of a PDB file.
    You need the PDB and PSF files for example for \ref tcl_imd.

\anchor tcl_writepsf
\verbatim
writepsf <file> { <N_P> <MPC> <N_CI> <N_pS> <N_nS> }
\endverbatim
writes the current topology to the file <file> (here <file> is not
a channel since additional information cannot be written anyways).
<N_P>, <MPC> and so on are parameters describing a system consisting
of equally long charged polymers, counterions and salt. This information
can be used to color the atoms in VMD. Of course different kinds of
topologies can also be handled by modified versions of writepsf.

\anchor tcl_writepdb
\verbatim
writepdb <file>
\endverbatim
writes the corresponding particle data.
