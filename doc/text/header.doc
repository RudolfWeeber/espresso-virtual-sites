\section introduction Introduction

Espresso is an MPI parallel molecular dynamics (MD) program developed
by members of Polyelectrolyte project
(<a href="http://www.mpip-mainz.mpg.de/~pep/index.html">PEP</a>) of the 
Theory group in <a href="http://www.mpip-mainz.mpg.de/">MPI-P</a>, Mainz, Germany.
Espresso can be used as an MD integrator for a variety of systems interacting
via soft potentials (in particular including Lennard-Jones potential and electrostatic interactions).
The program also allows to produce scientific movies using the
<a href="http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/vmd/current/ug/ug.html">VMD</a>
software package (the Espresso logo was produced by the program itself!).

To perform an MD simulation Espresso uses a 
<a href="http://tcl.activestate.com">Tcl</a> script
which gives the user control over the program.
The standard Tcl language was extended by some \ref tcl "additional commands"
which allow to perform a complete MD simulation. 

The script is interpreted on one node,
the master node, whereas the other nodes wait for the master node to issue
specific actions, i. e. a client-server model is utilized. More details
can be found in \ref communication.h "communication.h". During the
actual integration, however, the communication is done synchronously.
For more details see \ref integrate.c "integrate.c".

\section requirements Requirements

Script language: <a href="http://tcl.activestate.com">Tcl 8.3</a> or higher <br>

Supported operating systems:
<ul>
<li> LINUX (mpi programming environment: <a href="http://www.lam-mpi.org">lam</a>)
<li> OSF1
<li> AIX
</ul>
You have to adopt the corresponding Makefile to your system.

\section start Getting Started.

This section is only valid inside the theory cluster at the MPI-P in Mainz.

<ol>
<li> Get your PEP membership.
<li> Add the following lines to your .cshrc file.
\verbatim 
##################################################################
# Settings for ESPRESSO
##################################################################
if ( (`uname` == "Linux") ) then
    setenv PATH "${PATH}:.:/opt/lam/bin"
endif
# cvs root directory 
setenv CVSROOT ~pep/cvsroot
# TCL_MD source directory
setenv ESPRESSO_SOURCE  "your_directory/Espresso"
# TCL_MD script directory
setenv ESPRESSO_SCRIPTS "your_directory/Espresso/scripts"
\endverbatim
Replace your_directory by the directory where you want to install Espresso.
<li> Get your local copy of the latest stable release with:
\verbatim cvs checkout -r Kim Espresso \endverbatim
or with
\verbatim cvs checkout Espresso \endverbatim
for the latest cvs snapshot in the case you want to work on the code.
<li> Compile using 
\verbatim gmake \endverbatim
<li> Create documentation files (html, latex, man and rtf) using
\verbatim gmake docu\endverbatim
(This command works only on our Linux PCs (needs doxygen).
Use touch file_name.c if this does not work rightaway)
<li> Read the documentation carefully (Come on, there had been only 213 pages when I
was writing these lines) !!!
<li> Try the sample script files in \ref testsuite "testsuite directory".
<li> Complain if you experience problems.
</ol>

\section restrictions Restrictions

<ul>
<li> The long range part is implemented for full periodicity, cubic
box and cubic mesh only. The program will probably crash if you mix up 
things here.
</ul>

\section bugs Bugs

No bugs known at the moment.

\section plans Plans for the future
