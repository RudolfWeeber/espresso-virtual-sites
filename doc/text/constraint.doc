/** \page tcl_constraint The constraint command
        \verbatim constraint <type_name | delete> [parameters] \endverbatim
	A constraint is a surface which interacts with all particles via a Lennard-Jones potential.
	\f[4 \epsilon \left(\left(\frac{\sigma}{r}\right)^{12} -
	\left(\frac{\sigma}{r}\right)^6 + shift\right)\f]
	with r being the distance of the center of the particle to the surface. 
	The corresponding force acts in direction of the normal vector of the surcafe.
	Possible usages are:
	\verbatim constraint wall <n_x> <n_y> <n_z> <d> <lj_eps> <lj_sig> <lj_cut> <lj_shift> \endverbatim
	The resulting surface is a plane defined by the normal vector 
	<n_x> <n_y> <n_z> and the distnace <d> from the origin
	\verbatim constraint sphere <c_x> <c_y> <c_z> <rad> <lj_eps> <lj_sig> <lj_cut> <lj_shift> \endverbatim
	The resulting surface is a sphere with center <c_x> <c_y> <c_z> 
	and radius <rad>. The force is pointing inwards.
	\verbatim constraint delete <num> \endverbatim
	Delete constraint with number <num>. 
	This may change the numbers of the other constraints. 
	The contraint numbers can be obtained with:
	\verbatim constraint \endverbatim
	Print out all constraint information.
