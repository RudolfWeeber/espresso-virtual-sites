<li> <b> cell_model.tcl </b><br>
     This example shows the use of \ref tcl_constraint "constraints"
     and non periodic boundary conditions. It simulates a bundle of
     semiflexible polyelectrolyes with hydrophobic side chains
     neutralized by counterions in a spherical simulation cell.

<li> <b> diamond.tcl </b><br>
     This reproduces the data of S.Schneider/P.Linse, Eur.Phys.J.E <b>8</b>, 457-460 (2002):
     A diamond-shape network of 16 polyelectrolyte chains with 20 monomers each connected at 8 nodes is simulated for varying
     network packing fractions (densities) while the pressure is analysed (\ref tcl_analyze). 
     Similar to <i>kremerGrest.tcl</i> it additionally uses electrostatics including the auto-tuning feature (\ref tcl_inter).
