*                  ESPResSo installation
******************************************************************************

The ESPResSo compilation and installation process is decribed in
detail in the ESPResSo user's guide. When you have obtained the
sources in a .tar.gz file, the user's guide can be found in the file
"ug.pdf" in the subdirectory "doc/ug/" relative to the directory where
this file resided.

When you have obtained the sources from the ESPResSo-CVS or by other
means, the user's guide can be found on the ESPResSo-Homepage at

	http://www.espresso.mpg.de/


QUICK START
-----------
In many cases, once you have obtained the sources, compiling and
running ESPResSo requires only two steps:

> configure
> make
 
When both steps have completed successfully, you can run Espresso with
help of the command

> Espresso
