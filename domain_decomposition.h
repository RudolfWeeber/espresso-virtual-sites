/** \file domain_decomposition.h
 *
 *  This file contains everything related to the cell system: domain decomposition.
 *
 *  <b>Responsible:</b>
 *  <a href="mailto:limbach@mpip-mainz.mpg.de">Hanjo</a>
 *
 *  The simulation box is split into spatial domains for each node
 *  according to a cartesian node grid (\ref node_grid).
 *
 *  The domain of a node is split into a 3D cell grid with dimension
 *  \ref DomainDecomposition::cell_grid. Together with one ghost cell
 *  layer on each side the overall dimension of the ghost cell grid is
 *  \ref DomainDecomposition::ghost_cell_grid. The domain
 *  decomposition enables one the use of the linked cell algorithm
 *  which is in turn used for setting up the verlet list for the
 *  system. You can see a 2D graphical representation of the linked
 *  cell grid below.

 *
 *  2D representation of a linked cell grid: cell_grid =
 *  {4,4}, ghost_cell_grid = {6,6}
 *
 * Each cell has 3^D neighbor cells (For cell 14 they are
 * marked). Since we deal with pair forces, it is sufficient to
 * calculate only half of the interactions (Newtons law: actio =
 * reactio). We have chosen the upper half e.g. all neighbor cells with
 * a higher linear index (For cell 14 they are marked in light
 * blue). Caution: This implementation needs double sided ghost
 * communication! For single sided ghost communication one would need
 * some ghost-ghost cell interaction as well, which we do not need!

      A word about the interacting neighbor cells:

      In a 3D lattice each cell has 27 neighbors (including
      itself!). Since we deal with pair forces, it is sufficient to
      calculate only half of the interactions (Newtons law: actio =
      reactio). For each cell 13+1=14 neighbors. This has only to be
      done for the inner cells. 

      Caution: This implementation needs double sided ghost
      communication! For single sided ghost communication one would
      need some ghost-ghost cell interaction as well, which we do not
      need! 

      It follows: inner cells: n_neighbors = 14
      ghost cells:             n_neighbors = 0
