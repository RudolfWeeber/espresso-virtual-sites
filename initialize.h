/** \file initialize.h
    This file contains the hook procedures. These are the ones with names on_* and
    are called whenever something is changed in Espresso which might influence other parts. For example, the P3M code
    has to be reinitialized whenever the box size changes. The hooking mechanism allows to keep track of such changes.

    For this mechanism to work, two things have to be fulfilled. If some part of the code changes some property, it has
    to call the corresponding hook, i. e. on_particle_change if a particle property has been changed or
    on_short_range_ia_change, if a short ranged interaction has been changed.
    In turn procedures that depend on particle properties or the box size, should react to such changes in the
    corresponding hook procedure.

/** \name Hook procedures
    These procedures are called if several significant changes to
    the system happen which may make a reinitialization of subsystems
    necessary. Note that all these functions are called on ALL nodes.
    if you need to do something only on the master node, check
    \ref this_node == 0. The use of the asynchronous mpi_* functions
    (e. g. mpi_bcast_parameter) on the master node is possible.
