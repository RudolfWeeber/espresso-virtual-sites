This is the Molecular Dynamics software ESPResSo ("Extensible
Simulation Package for the Research on Soft Matter Systems").

ESPResSo is a parallelized, flexible molecular dynamics simulation
program for scientific coarse-grained simulations as they are used in
soft matter research.

You can find documentation on how to compile, use and develop ESPResSo
on the homepage at

	http://www.espressomd.org

ESPResSo is intended to be used by people that have proper knowledge
of simulation techniques and know how to use them. We do not take
responsibility if you use ESPResSo to create and publish bogus
results. You have been warned!

If you use ESPResSo and obtain scientific results that you publish, we
would ask you to acknowledge the usage of ESPResSo by referencing
