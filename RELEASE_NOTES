What's new, what's been changed, what's been fixed
--------------------------------------------------

***********
* v1.1.2a *
***********

Current working revision.
(a) December 19th, 2003.

New Features: 

(a) working version of tabulated lookup potentials is
now implemented.  Be sure to check documentation as file format
requirements are likely to change with new versions.
(b) comfixed interaction is implemented. This interaction fixes the center of mass of all particles of a given type. 
(c) comforce interaction is implemented. This interaction is used to apply a force on two differenent types of particles. The force is applied either along the major axis of type_1 particles (e.g. bundle of rods), or perpendicular to the major axis of type_1 particles in the direction of the vector joining center of mass's of type_1 and type_2.  

Changes:


Bugfixes:
(a) 'part <ind> delete' now correctly deletes all bonds involved
(b) 'part fix' fixed
(c) the constraint energy is printed correctly now. In the old version if the constraint particle type is smaller than any real particle type, the constraint energy was wrong, even though the total energy was correct.

Released on December 2nd, 2003.


- v1.1.0e -
-----------

(e) December 2nd, 2003.

(c) November 13th, 2003.
(b) November 11th, 2003.
(a) November 3rd, 2003.

New Features:
(e) command 'constraint maze' to create a constraint with a maze-like structure,
    i.e. spheres connected by cylinders 
(d) command 'imd positions' has new optional flag '-fold_chains'
(c) command 'part fix' has new optional parameters, i.e. 'part fix [<x> <y> <z>]'
(b) command 'analyze p_IK1' replacing 'analyze p_bin'
(a) command 'analyze p_bin' to derive the pressure tensor of a given particle list
(a) command 'analyze bin' to create a particle list distributed into spherical bins

Changes:
(-) none

Bugfixes:
(e) fixed 'tuning.c' on Darwin-systems (e.g. MacOS)
(e) fixed that 'communication.c' would not compile without electrostatics-flag on
(b) fixed implementation of 'analyze p_bin' to correspond to Kirkwood's IK1-scheme
(a) fixed that 'analyze <g1>' and 'analyze <g2>' derived all of <g1>, <g2>, and <g3>
    and always returned <g3> only
