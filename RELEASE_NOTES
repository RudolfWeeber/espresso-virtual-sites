What's new, what's been changed, what's been fixed
--------------------------------------------------

**********************
* v1.5.Gold (Neelix) *
**********************

Not yet released.


- v1.5.Alpha -
--------------

(b) January 15th, 2004.
(a) January  7th, 2004.

New Features: 
(a) new command 'cellsystem { domain | nsquare }' to choose the internal particle structure.
(a) comfixed interaction is implemented. This interaction fixes the center of mass 
    of all particles of a given type.
(a) comforce interaction is implemented. This interaction is used to apply a force 
    on two differenent types of particles. The force is applied either along the
    major axis of type_1 particles (e.g. bundle of rods), or perpendicular to the 
    major axis of type_1 particles in the direction of the vector joining center
    of mass's of type_1 and type_2.

Changes:
(a) completely reworked the internal particle structure, now having six substructures per particle
    and a choice of two entirely different particle administration systems (domain decomposition
    or homogeneous N^2-mode)
(b) 'analyze pressure ideal' does no longer use n_total_particles*temperature/volume but rather 
    measures the particles' velocities to deduct the ideal gas contribution to the pressure 
    from there; consequently, its value is at last the very same as the trace of p_IK1;
    note however, that the ideal gas now depends on whether or not ROTATION is compiled in
    (changing the degrees of freedom from 3 to 6), even if the particles don't use that property
(b) 'checkpoint_set' now also saves informations on external forces, fixed particles, and
    rotational properties if the corresponding flags are compiled in

Bugfixes:
(a) 'part fix' fixed
(a) the constraint energy is printed correctly now. In the old version, if 
    the constraint particle type is smaller than any real particle type, 
    the constraint energy was wrong, even though the total energy was correct
(b) fixed several memory leaks occuring when using newer version of the gcc-compiler
(b) fixed wrong prefactor of 'analyze pressure ideal' contained in early versions of v1.5.Alpha
 


***********
* v1.1.2  *
***********

Released on December 19th, 2003.


- v1.1.2a -
-----------

New Features: 
(a) working version of tabulated lookup potentials is
    now implemented.  Be sure to check documentation as file format
    requirements are likely to change with new versions.

Changes:
(-) none

Bugfixes:
(a) 'part <ind> delete' now correctly deletes all bonds involved



***********
* v1.1.1  *
***********

Released on December 2nd, 2003.


- v1.1.0e -
-----------

(e) December 2nd, 2003.
(d) November 18th, 2003.
(c) November 13th, 2003.
(b) November 11th, 2003.
(a) November 3rd, 2003.

New Features:
(e) command 'constraint maze' to create a constraint with a maze-like structure,
    i.e. spheres connected by cylinders 
(d) command 'imd positions' has new optional flag '-fold_chains'
(c) command 'part fix' has new optional parameters, i.e. 'part fix [<x> <y> <z>]'
(b) command 'analyze p_IK1' replacing 'analyze p_bin'
(a) command 'analyze p_bin' to derive the pressure tensor of a given particle list
(a) command 'analyze bin' to create a particle list distributed into spherical bins

Changes:
(-) none

Bugfixes:
(e) fixed 'tuning.c' on Darwin-systems (e.g. MacOS)
(e) fixed that 'communication.c' would not compile without electrostatics-flag on
(b) fixed implementation of 'analyze p_bin' to correspond to Kirkwood's IK1-scheme
(a) fixed that 'analyze <g1>' and 'analyze <g2>' derived all of <g1>, <g2>, and <g3>
    and always returned <g3> only
