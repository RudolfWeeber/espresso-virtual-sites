/** \file nsquare.h
    This file contains the code for a simple n^2 particle loop.

    <b>Responsible:</b>
    <a href="mailto:arnolda@mpip-mainz.mpg.de">Axel</a>

    The nsquare cell system performs a full n^2 particle interaction
    calculation over the simulation box.  Therefore every node just
    has a single cell containing all local particles plus one ghost
    cell per other node. The communication is done via broadcasts
    (exchange_ghosts and update_ghosts) and reduce operations
    (collect_ghost_force).
    
    The algorithm used for interaction calculation is parallelized,
    but a full communication is needed every time step. Let us assume
    that the number of nodes P is odd. Then a node p will do the
    interaction calculation with another node q iff \f$(q-p)\,mod\,P = 0\f$.
    Of course then every node has to do the same amount of work
    (provided the particles are distributed equally), and each
    interaction pair is done exactly once, since for odd P \f$r\,mod\,P\f$
    odd iff \f$-r\,mod\,P\f$ is even.

    The second main part of this cell system is a load balancer which
    at the beginning of the integration is called and balances the
    numbers of particles between the nodes. This means that the number
    of particles per node should be around \f$N/P\f$, so the goal is to
    let every processor have a number of particles which is one of the
    two integers closest to \f$N/P\f$. The algorithm is greedy, i. e. it
    searches for the node with most and least particles and transfers
    as much as possible particles between them so that at least one of
    them satisfies the constraints. Of course the algorithm terminates
    if both satisfy the condition without transfer.

    The calculations themselves are just simple loops over all
    appropriate particle pairs.
